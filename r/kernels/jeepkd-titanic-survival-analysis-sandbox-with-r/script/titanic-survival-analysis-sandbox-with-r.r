# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages
# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

library(ggplot2) # Data visualization
library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function
library(dplyr) # data manipulation

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

system("ls ../input")

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

train <- read.csv('../input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('../input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
full <- bind_rows(train, test)

# Grab title from passenger names

# Show title counts by sex

# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level

full$Title[full$Title %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'

# Show title counts by sex again

# Finally, grab surname from passenger name

                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])
