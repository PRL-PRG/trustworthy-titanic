# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages
# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

library(readr) # CSV file I/O, e.g. the read_csv function
library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualization
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
library('randomForest') # classification algorithm

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

system("ls ../input")

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.
train <- read.csv('../input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('../input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

full  <- bind_rows(train, test) # bind training & test data

str(full)

# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)

# Show title counts by sex
table(full$Sex, full$Title)

# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')

# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
full$Title[full$Title == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
full$Title[full$Title == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
full$Title[full$Title %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'

# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$Title)
