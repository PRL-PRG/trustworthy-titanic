# Introduction

This is my first stab at a Kaggle script. I have chosen to work with the Titanic dataset after spending some time poking around on the site and looking at other scripts made by other Kagglers for inspiration. I will also focus on doing some illustrative data visualizations along the way. I'll then use `randomForest` to create a model predicting survival on the Titanic. I am new to machine learning and hoping to learn a lot, so feedback is very welcome! 

There are three parts to my script as follows:

* Feature engineering
* Missing value imputation
* Prediction!

## Load and check data

```{r, message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualization
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
library('randomForest') # classification algorithm
```
