# This R environment comes with all of CRAN preinstalled, as well as many other helpful packages
# The environment is defined by the kaggle/rstats docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-rstats
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

library('ggplot2') # visualization
library('ggthemes') # visualization
library('scales') # visualization
library('dplyr') # data manipulation
library('mice') # imputation
library('randomForest') # classification algorithm

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory
